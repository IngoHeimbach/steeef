# steeef
Zsh steeef theme as a standalone repository. The purpose behind this repo is avoid having a
dependency on oh-my-zsh when using the steeef theme. Zsh plugin managers such as Antibody can use
the theme without having to use oh-my-zsh. Credits to the original theme authors.

Example usage with Antibody:

    source <(antibody init)
    antibody bundle danihodovic/steeef
